Detailed results for each execution are prensented in 2 different files. The
file "instance.sol" presents, for a given execution, the total cost of the best
solution found, the solving time and the iteration at which this solution was
reached, along with the routes of this solution, e.g.:

Total cost:             620.23  
Solving time:             0.88  
Iteration:              327872  

Vehicle type:  2  
Route:             0    5    4    6    2    9    0  

Vehicle type:  1  
Route:             0    1    7   10    0  

Vehicle type:  2  
Route:             0    8    3    0  


The file "instance.evo" presents, for a given execution, the evolution of the
best solution found. Whenever a new best solution is found, its cost is
presented along with the solving time and the iteration of the execution,
e.g.:
